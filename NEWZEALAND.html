        New Zealand is a bucket list place for so many people and it’s the perfect destination for solo travellers. The
        country is so diverse with impeccable nature and adrenaline filled activities, making it an unbelievable
        beginner friendly solo travel destination. While it’s a great solo travel country, your suspicions are correct,
        New Zealand is very expensive to travel. To combat the high pricetags attached to travelling to New Zealand, a
        lot of solo travellers opt to do a year working holiday. The best part is, it’s very easy to obtain a working
        holiday visa. You can read more about them here.

        While New Zealand is a small country, it has a lot to offer, especially for nature lovers. From its pristine
        glaciers, mountains, rainforests, beaches, and Fiords to the bustling cityscapes, there is so much to choose
        from in New Zealand. Not only does it have endless activities to enjoy, it’s incredibly safe for solo
        travellers, and there is a great backpacker scene all year round!
        <br><br>
        The best way to travel around New Zealand is either by renting a van (Jucy is one of the most popular companies
        to do this) or a hop-on hop-off bus. Check out Kiwi Experience for a great backpacker friendly option (that’s
        also great for first time solo travellers)!
