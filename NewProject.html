        People travel because of different reasons, some of which are personal, while others are job oriented. Traveling
        alone is a growing trend and almost 60% of Americans say they would travel alone to another US city.
        <br><br>
        Many people travel solo out of choice whereas others do so because they were not able to find a travel
        companion. According to Google, search volume for the term "solo travel" more than quadrupled from 2014 to 2020.
        <br><br>
        Solo female travel is particularly on the rise. A survey found that 50% of the women worldwide had been on a
        holiday on their own and that they travel alone more than men.
        <br><br>
        Since 2015, when the first solo female travel group on Facebook was created, many more online communities have
        appeared to connect women traveling solo and the number of tour companies offering women-only tours has
        skyrocketed.

        Advantages of travelling alone üôÜ :-
    </h2>
    <ul type="disc">
        <font size="4">

        <li>Your time and budget are your own: It's all up to you how much time to spend someplace, what your daily
            modes of travel will be, what places you visit, where you eat, how much you spend or when you wake up.
            Flexibility in your travel choices is often the number one reason people prefer to travel on their own.</li>
            <br>
        <li>
            Reflection and personal growth: Solo travel gives you the ability to spend time with one-self, for
            introspection, self-actualization or for personal growth. You can travel on your own to a yoga retreat, to
            join a meditation program, to a surfing camp, or to a wellness resort. Transformative travel is a growing
            trend that is best enjoyed on your own.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Build self-confidence: Many people decide to travel on their own to prove themselves they can do it or to
            overcome a fear or anxiety. Solo travel is seen as the ultimate bravery and being able to that means the
            encouragement and belief that anything is possible and helps a lot of people, especially women, build
            self-confidence.</li>
            <br>
        <li>
            It's easier to make friends: Many great opportunities to interact with the locals on a personal level can be
            found and enjoyed when you are not distracted by a conversation with your travel companion. When traveling
            alone, you make yourself more interesting and accessible to locals and to other travelers who might approach
            you and strike a conversation.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Personal learning: When you are on your own without anyone to rely on or to blame, you have an opportunity
            to learn. This can be a new skill such as bargaining, a language that you spoke a little of, problem-solving
            unexpected setbacks and complications, or a new point of view on reality. Traveling alone gives you the
            mental and physical space to learn.</li>

        Disadvantages of travelling alone üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è :-
    </h2>
    <ul type="disc">
        <font size="4">

        <li>Inconvenience: There is nobody to help you carry things, to split queueing with you, to ask for directions, or to help Google something, you are on your own.</li>
            <br>
        <li>
            Affordability: It's more expensive, as there is no one to share costs with. Rooms are usually about the same price for one or for two. You'll need to budget a little bit more. Cruise companies can sometimes charge a "single supplement" which is a surcharge added to the fare of a passenger travelling alone.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Vulnerability and fear: One of the main disadvantages of traveling alone is the lack of someone who can help you feel safe and the perceived vulnerability of being on your own. This is also one of the main reasons why people don't travel on their own.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Loneliness: Traveling alone means having meals on your own, seeing incredible places without someone to share them with, or experiencing once in a lifetime moments with nobody for company. Even those who love traveling solo will experience moments of solitude and loneliness on their travels.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Arguments with family and loved ones: As a relatively new trend, many travelers still have to convince family and loved ones that traveling alone is fine, especially women and younger travelers.</li>
