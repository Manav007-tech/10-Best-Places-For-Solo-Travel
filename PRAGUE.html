        Another amazing European city for solo travellers is Prague, Czechia. Prague is very similar to Budapest in
        terms of safety, lots of things to see and do, great nightlife and very social – a perfect first time solo
        travel destination option. One thing I think is important for destinations is whether a city is walkable or not.
        Prague is a great European city for this, and wandering through the streets by foot is a great way to get around
        and fully immerse yourself in the city.
        <br><br>
        Prague offers a great, busy atmosphere all year round and has lots of gorgeous architecture and interesting
        history. Here you can dabble in some activities that are new to you, like watching a classical concert or
        visiting one of the most beautiful libraries in the world.
        <br><br>
        Prague is also a great city for nightlife and is named one of the best cities in Europe for partying.

        <b>Prague is a social, beautiful city which is easily accessible within Europe via plane or bus/train. It’s
            great for culture, history and nightlife.

            WHERE TO STAY IN PRAGUE :</h2>
        <br><br>
        Prague is a fairly big city and the best part of the city to stay in is the Old Town. Staying in or around the
        Old Town means the main attractions are very walkable and there are plenty of great bars and restaurants to
        check out. Alternatively, Malá Strana is a great neighbourhood to stay in. While it’s across the river from a
        lot of the main sights, Prague Castle, the Lennon Wall and Prague’s narrowest alley are all in this area.
        <br><br>
        Prague has plenty of great hostels, however, Roadhouse and Madhouse are the best by far. These hostels are world
        renowned and have won many awards. Please note these book out well in advance, especially in the summer, so make
        sure you put your booking in early!
