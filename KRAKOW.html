        Krakow, Poland is a personal favourite choice of mine. The city is often overlooked, but is one of the best hubs in Europe as an affordable, safe and fun destination, especially for solo travellers. Krakow is another European destination that offers a lot for both the day and nighttime and is bustling with tourists all year round. 
        <br><br>
        For history lovers, there is a lot of really dark, intricate history to learn about – the Museum of Torture and the Museum of Krakow are both really worth a visit. Krakow is also where you can do a day trip to Auschwitz-Birkenau, one of the former Nazi concentration camps. 
        <br><br>
        Krakow is a great city to wander and explore. With each neighbourhood very different to the next. The Old Town is small, so a lot of the sights are found outside of the centre. However, everything is walkable from each other and Krakow is also a great city if you’re on a budget! Krakow is a great city to explore, and if you do enjoy nature, heading out to the neighbouring mountain town of Zakopane is the perfect day trip addition to your trip. Or even choose to stay for a few nights!
        <br><br>
        Prague is also a great city for nightlife and is named one of the best cities in Europe for partying.

        <b>Krakow is perfect for a weekend away and anyone who loves: history, culture, nightlife and architecture.
            <br><br>
            Affordability: Inexpensive</b>

            WHERE TO STAY IN KRAKOW :</h2>
        <br><br>
        Krakow has a great range of accommodation options, especially social hostels that are calling your name! The Old Town is where all the action takes place, however accommodation can be a little more expensive in the centre, so choosing somewhere just outside the Old Town can give you the best of both worlds. 
        <br><br>
        For hostels, Greg and Tom’s Beer House is a great option. With a social atmosphere and free breakfast, dinner and a free hour of beer, this hostel offers a lot for solo travellers. For a more quiet version, check out Greg and Tom’s Home Hostel, which is the original of the chain. This hostel is a 10 minute walk out of the Old Town and is a lot more quiet than the Beer House, but you get to join in on the free beer and dinners!
