        <b>Budapest is one of the best cities in Europe for solo travel.</b> Safe, bustling with things to do and an
        amazing
        atmosphere, it’s hard not to love Hungary’s capital. For first time solo travellers, Budapest offers a great mix
        of activities while still being affordable. Whether you’re interested in checking out the vibrant party culture
        or you want to delve more into the interesting history of Hungary, there is plenty to do in the city that can
        easily fill up your days and nights.
        <br><br>
        Some of the best things to do in the city that you definitely can’t miss out on (and that are great for solo
        travellers) is: Budapest’s famous thermal baths (Szechinyi and Géllert are the most famous), Climb St. Stephen’s
        Basilica, river cruise down the Danube and checking out the Jewish Quarter/District 7. These activities are
        great for getting an overview of the city, and they aren’t expensive!
        <br><br>
        <b>Budapest has a lot of ground to cover in the day and also comes alive at night time.</b> If you love a night
        out,
        this is the place to come, even when solo travelling. Budapest has some of the best bars and clubs in Europe,
        while also having great, social party hostels to tie the whole experience together.

            WHERE TO STAY IN BUDAPEST :</h2>
        Budapest has a lot of great accommodation options to choose from. For solo travellers looking to get out and
        meet people, Hive Hostel, Avenue Hostel, and Carpe Noctum are all great hostel options that offer safe,
        comfortable accommodation. Personally I would go for Carpe Noctum, it’s won many awards over the years as
        one of the best hostels worldwide!
        <br><br>
        For hotel options, check out Boutique Hotel Budapest and Roombach Hotel. These options are comfortable and
        within walking distance of all the main attractions, while also being very reasonably priced.
