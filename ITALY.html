        Italy is a country that has almost everything you could need, and if you’re a foodie, you’re in the right place.
        From the intricate architecture of Florence to the cooling waters of Bari, Italy has so much to offer and is
        another great choice for first time solo travellers. While there is a lot to offer across the whole of the
        country, there are some areas that are better catered and more importantly – safer, than others.
        <br><br>
        For example, avoid Naples or Milan, both aren’t great choices for first time solo travellers. These destinations
        are known for their crime and pickpocketing, and this isn’t a great way to start your solo travel adventures.
        Instead check out Lake Como, Florence, Cinque Terre or even Verona.
        <br><br>
        Italy is drenched in rich history, and is the perfect solo travel destination for lovers of history,
        architecture and culture. It’s easy to spend days visiting museums and galleries and exploring the winding
        alleyways, and if you’re looking for your ‘Eat, Pray’ Love’ moment, this might be it. While the cities are
        packed with people, it takes less than an hour by public transport to head out of the city centres and discover
        the Italian countryside for some quiet.
        <br><br>
        Prague is also a great city for nightlife and is named one of the best cities in Europe for partying.
