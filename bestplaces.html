                Solo travel can feel daunting, especially if it‚Äôs your first time. That is why, after 7 years of travel
                and
                over 60 countries later, I‚Äôve created this list with the 15 best first time solo travel destinations.
                <br>
                There are so many choices in the world for places to go and if you‚Äôre not too sure where to even start
                looking, it can be a little too much to comprehend. I remember my first time solo, I was nervous,
                excited
                and a little overwhelmed. I went in with no research, and while I enjoyed my first solo trip (which was
                to
                Luxembourg), I definitely could have picked somewhere a little more catered to solo travellers.
                Ultimately,
                the destination you choose will determine how much you enjoy your first solo trip, so it‚Äôs imperative
                that
                you pick wisely, with this post, I hope I can give you a guiding hand to the best choices!
                <br>
                Here are the 10 best first time solo travel destinations.
                <br>
                These places are perfect for your first ever solo trip, being: safe, fun, with plenty of other
                travellers
                and lots to see/do/eat! What more could you want for your first solo travel adventure? As someone who
                has
                solo travelled for 6 years, I have been to my fair share of places and these are destinations I can
                wholeheartedly recommend for a first timer.
                <br>
                These 10 best first time solo travel destinations hit the main criteria I mark each destination against:
                safety, activities, easily accessible, affordable, communication and being busy with other travellers.
                These
                criteria are what I think are the most important for not only feeling safe and comfortable but
                ultimately
                having the best time possible as a newbie solo traveller.

                WHAT IS THE CRITERIA<br> FOR
                THE BEST FIRST TIME SOLO TRAVEL DESTINATION?

            SAFETY :
        </h2>
        <li>
            Safety is one of the biggest concerns as a traveller, and solo travelling can often heighten that concern.
            These
            destination are some of the safest and most comfortable I‚Äôve felt while travelling solo, so you can feel
            reassured that you can enjoy your time fully. Safety includes feeling comfortable walking around alone,
            being
            able to walk around at night time, and a feeling of reassurance that you‚Äôre okay solo.
            <br>
            In saying this, safety precautions should be practiced everywhere you travel! I can only ever speak from my
            personal experience as a solo traveller, and it‚Äôs important to always practice safety while travelling.
        </li><br><br>
        <h2 align="left">
            AFFORDABLE :
        </h2>
        <li>
            While not all of these places are affordable, there are some great options for those who are on a tight
            budget. Each place will be categorised into: affordable, midrange and expensive, so you can get a gage on
            how accessible it is for you.
        </li><br><br>
        <h2 align="left">
            BUSY WITH OTHER TRAVELLERS :
        </h2>
        <li>
            Travelling is about meeting amazing locals, but also connecting with other travellers. For first time solo
            travellers, choosing a destination that is a little more popular with other travellers can relieve some of
            the stress of navigating completely solo and will give plenty of opportunities for new friends. These 15
            destinations are great for travellers and backpackers and you‚Äôll have no problems finding people to hang out
            with on your trip.
