            At the top of the list as one of the best first time solo travel destinations is Bali, Indonesia. This is
            the
            perfect introduction to South East Asia as it’s very catered to Westerners, while still holding the essence
            of
            Balinese charm. Bali has the perfect mix of surf, amazing cafes, temples, incredible nature and the
            friendliest
            locals, while also being a very affordable option to choose.
            <br><br>
            Bali is particularly perfect if you want an introduction to South East Asia and you’re not sure where to
            begin.
            Balinese people speak amazing English and because it’s so popular with tourists, you’ll have no problem
            finding
            other solo travellers to connect with during your time here to explore the island.
            <br><br>
            In Bali, you can find cascading waterfalls, rice terraces that stretch out over the hills, jungles, and
            beaches
            built from a surfer’s dream. Bali also has another side to it, made for the beach clubgoers, daily brunch
            girls and
            ravers. So whether you’re a yoga lover or all night partier, Bali is very diverse in what it offers solo
            travellers.
            <br><br>
            The south of Bali is the most popular area where you’ll find other travellers, however, because Bali is so
            safe you
            can easily explore the whole island and go off the tourist trail very easily. For more places in Indonesia
            that are
            great for solo travellers, you can also check out Nusa Penida, Gili Trawangan (Gili T), Lombok and even the
            Komodo
            Islands.

    Bali is the perfect mix of culture, nature, good food and affordable!

    <b>Affordability:</b> Inexpensive

        WHERE TO STAY IN BALI :
    </h2>
    Bali has a lot of different areas on offer to explore. <B>The main spots tourists tend to stay are:</B>
    <br><br><br>
    <li>Ubud</li>
    <li>Sanur</li>
    <li>Uluwatu</li>
    <li>Seminyak</li>
    <br><br><br>
    All these locations are in the south of the island and are only a couple of hours from each other. To get around
    Bali there’s an app called Gojek (similar to Uber), which you can use for rides within Bali. Or opt for hiring a
    motorbike, which is very inexpensive and a lot of fun.
    <br><br>
    Canggu and Ubud are my personal favourites out of these areas, and some great hostel recommendations are Farm Hostel
    in Canggu and Puri Garden Hostel in Ubud.
    <br><br><br><br>
