        Croatia had a sudden boom in tourism over the last 10 years, expedited by the popularity of Game of Thrones.
        Croatia is a gorgeous country situated on the Adriatic Sea and is a country that consists of rugged mountain
        ranges, architecture that dates back to the Romans and pristine blue waters. There is so much to offer from
        their 70+ islands and mainland, and while there are some well known tourist spots like Dubrovnik, that can get
        kind of crazy in the summer months, there are also some lovely, lesser known destinations in Croatia that would
        offer you solo travel ‘relax and disconnect’ vibe.
        <br><br>
        Croatia has gotten a lot more expensive over the years, even since I spent a summer working in Split. However it
        is a great first time solo travel destination because of a few different reasons. It’s very easy to travel
        within via ferry and bus, locals are very friendly and have great English, and despite being very busy, it’s
        super safe for solo travellers.
        <br><br>
        A great way to cover a lot of ground when you’re in Croatia is by doing a sailing week through the islands. I
        had one of these experiences with TruTravels and absolutely loved my time. The week takes you through some of
        the best spots in Croatia including Split, Mjlet National Park, Korčula, Dubrovnik and Hvar, so you get a little
        taster of everything!
