        If warm weather, beautiful beaches, great cafe culture and endless pastel de natas sound right up your alley,
        then Portugal is perfect for you. Portugal is incredibly safe, easily accessible and a very affordable European
        solo travel destination. There is a lot to discover within Portugal, whether you’re a city girl or a nature
        lover.
        <br><br>
        For first time solo travellers, especially those who may be a little nervous/apprehensive, Lisbon is a great
        city to start off with. Although it’s a capital city, it doesn’t feel the same level of intensity as other large
        capitals, for example, Paris or Rome. Instead, everything is very walkable, with a low crime rate and plenty to
        see along the way. Making it a perfect first stop on your solo travel adventures.
        <br><br>
        Unlike other places in Western Europe, Portugal retains being very affordable for a visit, and is great for a
        long weekend! Especially with the affordable flights you can find from the UK and Europe. It’s to be expected
        that Lisbon is more expensive than other parts of the country, but I was really pleasantly surprised by how
        affordable I found Porto.
