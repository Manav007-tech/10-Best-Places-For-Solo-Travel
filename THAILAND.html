        Thailand is by far one of the best choices for a first time solo travel destination. The country is rich in culture, while also being safe for travellers, very affordable, friendly locals and incredibly easy to navigate. Much like Bali, this is a great introduction to South East Asia. In Thailand a lot of locals speak amazing English, so you can really get a taste of the local culture while not feeling ridiculously overwhelmed.

        Thailand is very easy to get around, with a great connection of ferries, trains and buses. And also very affordable domestic flights! Sticking to the typical tourist routes through the north or island hopping in the south means that there are lots of transport options, which are comfortable and very safe. 12Go is the best place to book transport while travelling Thailand.

        Some of the most popular destinations to visit (that are great for first time solo travellers) are: Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Pai, Krabi and Koh Tao. The Full Moon Party on Koh Phangan is also an iconic destination, although it’s important to be extra careful if you’re planning on doing this solo as there can be robbing and spiking, so try and get a hostel group together if you can.
